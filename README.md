#How to Play

When prompted, select your difficulty and character.

Each time you encounter a monster, you can choose to use a special attack. If you select the special attack, you deal more damage, but you also take more damage. When a monster is killed, you may either encounter a new monster or you may win the game.

The game is over when all the monsters are killed, or when you are killed.
